4.over stats:(batsmen and bowler no need to match)

#ipl edition no. as 1,2,3...14
#match no. for batting team
#venue set as average runs scored in venue in 6 overs
#innings
#no. of batsmen
#no. of bowlers
#batting team name
#output is runs scored in 6 overs by batting team

The standard inputs are name of venue innings number
Two Types:
1. For Bowler Prediction: runs in 6 overs, all other batsmen in 6 overs  
2. For Batsman Prediction: runs in 6 overs, all other bowlers in 6 overs 

Finally display runs as output:
Type 1: Add all runs of bowlers
Type 2: Add runs of Batsmen
